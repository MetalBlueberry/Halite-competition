# Plan

## Simulation

- Find if can be run inside docker. (YES)
    - Write requirements for sending bots
- Run simulations on demand in the cloud.
    - Evaluate Fargate vs simple EC2 instances
- Prepare a visualization tool for the results.

So far I'm able to simulate games inside a container in a linux environment using the manager.

## Material

- Prepare instructions to install
  - Halite
  - Visualizer
- Prepare some material (videos/ documents) for the sessions
  - Base game logic
  - Vector math
  - Path finding
  - Game strategies

## Organization

- Program session days from now to the end of the year.
- Find the appropriate community to host the event.
