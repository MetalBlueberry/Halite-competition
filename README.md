# Halite competition

This is [the presentation](https://metalblueberry.github.io/Halite-competition/#/) shown at the first community session.

To start playing/hacking right now, just follow the instructions in [the community-specific how-to document](https://github.com/MetalBlueberry/Halite-competition/blob/master/docs/README.md).

When you browse [the halite official docs](https://2017.halite.io/), keep in mind that the community uses version 2 of halite (2017), not versions 1 or 3.
