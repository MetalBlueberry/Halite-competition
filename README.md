# Halite competition

Check out [the presentation](https://metalblueberry.github.io/Halite-competition/#/) shown at the first community session (don't miss [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke0P1jP891c&feature=youtu.be)).

To start playing/hacking right now, just follow the instructions in the community-specific [user guide](https://github.com/MetalBlueberry/Halite-competition/blob/master/docs/README.md).

When you browse [the halite official docs](https://2017.halite.io/), keep in mind that the community uses version 2 of halite (2017), not versions 1 or 3.

Remember also joining the [microsoft teams group](https://outlook.office.com/owa/grhalite-erni@erni.ch/groupsubscription.ashx?action=join), for receiving updates and asking and answering questions from the other participants.
